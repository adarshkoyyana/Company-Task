# Company-Task
# Description:
This project is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The application allows users to manage customer records stored in a PostgreSQL database. It provides functionalities such as adding records, viewing records in a paginated table format, searching records by name or location, and sorting records by date or time.

 # Features:
Database Initialization: Automatically creates and populates a PostgreSQL database with 50 dummy records upon setup.
Single Page Application (SPA): Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the data.
Pagination: Displays records in a table format with 20 records per page and allows users to navigate through pages.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for records by customer name or location.
Sorting: Provides the option to sort records either by date or time.
Separate Display of Created At: Displays the "created_at" column data in two separate columns as "date" and "time" for better readability.

# Technologies Used:
1. React.js
2. Node.js
3. Express.js
4. PostgreSQL
5. HTML/CSS
6. Bootstrap (for styling)
